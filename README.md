# UK Industry Employment Growth (1997-2024)

## Project Summary

I looked at how the number of jobs has changed year on year in the UK, from 1997 up to 2024. I focused on three key industries, you see:

* Education
* Human Health and Social Work
* Information and Communication

## Methodology

I used Python to analyse the data, which I got from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The file I used was called "EMP13 Employment by Industry". Here's what I did:

1.  **Data Preparation:** I cleaned up and organised the raw data, made it all nice and tidy.
2.  **Growth Calculation:** I worked out the percentage change in employment from one year to the next.
3.  **Visualisation:** I made some line graphs to show how the job numbers changed over time.

## Purpose

The aim of this project was to get a clear picture of the employment growth trends in these important UK industries and to flex my Python skills.

## Tools Used

* Python (programming language)
* Pandas (data manipulation library)
* Matplotlib (data visualisation library)

## Data Source

* Office for National Statistics (ONS) - "EMP13 Employment by Industry"

This project provides a factual overview of employment changes in the specified UK industries.
