# UK Industry Employment Growth (1997-2024)

## Project Summary

This project looks at how the number of jobs has changed each year in the UK from 1997 to 2024. We focused on three important areas:

* Education
* Human Health and Social Work
* Information and Communication

## Methodology

We used Python to study data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The data file was called "EMP13 Employment by Industry." Here's what we did:

1.  **Data Preparation:** We cleaned and organized the data to make it easy to use.
2.  **Growth Calculation:** We figured out the percentage change in jobs from one year to the next.
3.  **Visualization:** We made line graphs to show how job numbers changed over time.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to show the trends in job growth in these UK industries and to practice using Python.

## Tools Used

* Python (programming language)
* Pandas (data manipulation library)
* Matplotlib (data visualization library)

## Data Source

* Office for National Statistics (ONS) - "EMP13 Employment by Industry"

This project gives a clear picture of how jobs have changed in these UK industries.
